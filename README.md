## Dataset
- The dataset contains 25,000 rows and 11 columns.
- Each row represents a customer, and the columns represent various features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and transaction history.
- The target variable is labeled 'churn' and indicates whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## Data Preprocessing
- Missing Values: Handled using mean imputation.
- Categorical Variables: Encoded using one-hot encoding.
- Scaling: Features were scaled using StandardScaler to standardize their values.

## Model
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Parameters: Default parameters were used.
- Evaluation Metric: Accuracy

## Evaluation
- The dataset was split into training and testing sets with a test size of 20%.
- The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set using accuracy as the evaluation metric.
- Model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set.

## Results
- Accuracy: X%
- Insights: Feature X was found to be the most important predictor of churn.

## Future Work
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Explore additional features or data sources to enhance predictive power.
